# CHIP490_FHIR_SmartOnFHIR
This is a repository for the coursework and assignments associated with CHIP 490_FHIR_Spring2022 at UNC - especially for developing a variety of Launchers and App pages using HTML and JavaScript to Demo various contexts and functionality when using FHIR to interact with Epic and similar EHR systems.

My URL for [smarthealthit launch](https://launch.smarthealthit.org/?auth_error=&fhir_version_2=r4&iss=&launch_ehr=1&launch_url=&patient=&prov_skip_auth=1&provider=&pt_skip_auth=1&public_key=&sde=&sim_ehr=1&token_lifetime=15&user_pt=) is https://jiao826.github.io/smartlaunch.html

What I played with the launched app:
* physician-facing app
