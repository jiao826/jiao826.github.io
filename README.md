## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I`m Jiao Li :smiley:
I`m Jiao Li and currently an MPS student in Biomedical and Health Informatics in the CHIP program. I work full-time at a pharmaceutical company, focusing on digital biomarkers and digital health solution development. Previously, I was a Business Insight consultant, helping clients from various industries find insights from data and build data utilization platforms. I am a big fan of nature and Samoyed. 
* Skills: Pharmaceutical Regulatory Science / Digital Biomarkers / Business Insight / Project Management

## Health data topics interesting to me
* **Digital Biomarkers:** Consumer-generated physiological and behavioral measures are collected through connected digital tools to explain, influence and/or predict health-related outcomes.
* **Digital Therapeutics:** Digital therapeutics (DTx) deliver medical interventions directly to patients using evidence-based, clinically evaluated software to treat, manage, and prevent a broad spectrum of diseases and disorders.
* **Digital Patient Monitoring and Management:** Use of digital technologies to monitor and capture medical and other health data from patients and electronically transmit this information to healthcare providers for assessment and, when necessary, recommendations and instructions.
* **Personalized Healthcare:** An overarching framework for care that unifies predictive technologies with an engaged patient to coordinate care with the primary aim of promoting health and preventing disease.

## Project ideas
### Mental health monitoring and management
* :exclamation: **Problem:** The COVID-19 pandemic may have brought many changes to our life. Faced with new realities of working from home, temporary unemployment, home-schooling of children, and lack of physical contact with others, we may experience stress, anxiety, fear, sadness, and loneliness. Moreover, mental health disorders, including anxiety and depression, can worsen. Some people have increased their use of alcohol, tobacco, or drugs. It is important that we correctly understand and look after our mental health for all of those reasons. There are some common mental health questionnaires and mental health self-care guidelines. However, self-assessed mental health outcomes may be subjective, and people may feel challenged to change their behaviors. Hence, objective measurements and interventions for mental health remotely are essential.   
* :couple: **Audience:** All adults in the US, primary care physicians.
* :bulb: **Solution:** Adults install a validated mental health monitoring app (e.g., an app like StressScan) in their smartphones. Adults measure mental health every day (e.g., by placing a finger over the camera for two minutes so that the app can analyze changes in heart rate and measure the level of mental and physical stress) and check their records on the app. Mental health data is transferred to the EHR system only with each individual's agreement. Primary physicians get an alert from EHR system if the individual`s mental health reaches the threshold. Primary physicians follow up and intervene accordingly.
